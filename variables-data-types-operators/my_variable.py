# a variable is alocated memory space to store something.
# in python we can just declare variable by assigning them using the :
# = sign


# Convention:
# Note: Naming is hard, but you should give meaningful names, Not x and y\
# Lower case and use underscores

# Creation and assignment of a variable
my_variable = "I'm a variable"

# Reassignment of variable

my_variable = "Y not"

print(my_variable)
print(type(my_variable))

another_var = 10

print(another_var)
print(type(another_var))
